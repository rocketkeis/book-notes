Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know (2021)
By Adam Grant

## Prologue

First-instinct fallacy

...convinced that revising their answer will *hurt* their score.
Only a quarter of the changes were from right to wrong, while half were from wrong to right.

Cognitive laziness ...we often prefer the ease of hanging on to old views over the difficulty of grappling with new ones.

Psychologists call this seizing and freezing. We favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt... We listen to views that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard.

I did some research on this popular story recently and discovered a wrinkle: it isn't true.

This book is an invitation to let go of knowledge and opinions that are no longer serving you well, and to anchor your sense of self in flexibility rather than consistency.

A hallmark of wisdom is knowing when it's time to abandon some of your most treasured tools—and some of the most cherished parts of your identity.

Progress is impossible without change; and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything. —George Bernard Shaw

Phil Tetlock

As we think and talk, we often slip into the mindsets of three different professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians.
* preacher mode when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy. we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals
* prosecutor mode when we recognize flaws in other people's reasoning. we marshal arguments to prove them wrong and win our case.
* politician mode when we're seeking to win over an audience. we campaign and lobby for the approval of our constituents
